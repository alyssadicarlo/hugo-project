## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup fresh orange juice

- ⅓ cup fresh lemon juice

- ⅓ cup packed brown sugar

- ½ teaspoon grated orange zest

- ½ teaspoon grated lemon zest

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- 2 cups cubed fresh pineapple

- 2 cups strawberries, hulled and sliced

- 3 kiwi fruit, peeled and sliced

## Directions

**Step 1.**

Bring orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, orange zest, and lemon zest to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to cool.

**Step 2.**

Layer the fruit in a large, clear glass bowl in this order: pineapple, strawberries, kiwi fruit, bananas, oranges, grapes, and blueberries. Pour the cooled sauce over the fruit. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours before serving.
